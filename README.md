# Goals
- To introduce experienced programmers to working with Clojure in a 2-hr meetup or similar session
# Intended audience
- Programmers experienced with at least one programming language and the command-line
# Outcomes
- Attendees feel confident enough with Clojure and its tooling to explore further on their own
# Scope
- Get a feel of Clojure the language
- Start right away with the tooling i.e. REPL and friends
- Learn by doing, practice rhythm, praxis, we'll switch between theory and practice
- Develop simple programs, Project Euler would be a good fit
# Decisions
- Our choice of editor is vanilla emacs and add-ons for Clojure and navigation
- Choice of editor is governed by what is most feasible to support
- Choice of editor is goverened by the importance of getting everyone started on an even footing
- The advanatges of these 2 will offset difficulties related to learning curve
- To smoothen any learning curve, we'll introduce new knowledge right where they are needed
- The choice of editor and tooling here is only for the session, it's a means to an end at best
# What we won't get into

- Superiority of FP
# Setup
